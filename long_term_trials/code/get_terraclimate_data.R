## Data Limitations as expressed by authors:
## 1. Long-term trends in data are inherited from parent datasets. TerraClimate 
##    should not be used directly for independent assessments of trends.
## 2. TerraClimate will not capture temporal variability at finer scales than 
##    parent datasets and thus is not able to capture variability in orographic 
##    precipitation ratios and inversions.
## 3. The water balance model is very simple and does not account for heterogeneity 
##    in vegetation types or their physiological response to changing environmental conditions.
## 4. Limited validation in data-sparse regions (e.g., Antarctica)
