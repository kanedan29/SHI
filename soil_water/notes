Worked on revisiting analysis. Going to use 'Paper' as a random factor in models. Even though I can standardize IR and SOC data to some degree, slight differences in the methods make it hard to get them completely consistent for a meta-regression approach. I think it's still worth it, though, to standardize depths for the SOC data to some degree if needed. Seems the deepest any samples were taken was 30 cm, but don't want to compare papers where the deepest was 5 or 10 cm to papers where samples were taken to 30. 

Only big remaining question is if I'm accounting for controls correctly. Right now, I'm parsing controls based on y/n for a particular conservation ag treatment (i.e. tillage or cover). If an observation is n for tillage, say, then it is a control for tillage data. Problem with this is it could be a y for some other conservation ag approach. Maybe I should identify controls as observations with no conservation ag treatments?

Also, need to check if I was counting residue retention as organic amendment in treatment classifications. In retrospect that does not make sense if I was.

Remove Rusinamhodzi et al. 2012 from the analysis. Comparison is actually based on intercropping and how long it's been done. No other similar papers.
- Marking BAU controls for all papers for the basis of LRRs, etc. 

9/23/20. 

- In deciding to use BAU controls, realizing that some treatments ID'ed as BAUs might be based on a summary of data from combined treatments. For now, I'll ID those papers here and decide whether or not to exclude them at a later point:

Singh et al. 2016 (infiltration reported based on residue/no residue split and tillage splits)
Sharma et al. 2010 (design was a split plot factorial, main trt was residue additions, split was fertilization, unclear how results are aggregated for infiltration, will ignore fertilizer
data, may include residue mgmt data)
Abdollahi and Munkholm 2014 (Data aggregated across tillage and cover splits rather than reported on factorial)

- Other notes:
For Masri and Ryan 2006, I chose to use the fallow rotation rather than continuous wheat as the BAU scenario.

9.24.2020.

- Reviewed all papers in the original biblio and realized that several candidate papers were missed. Also realized original dataset could use cleaning. 

9.28.2020.

- Locke et al. 2013, infiltration rate data taken at multiple row positions relative to plants. Recording only those data from the within-row position.

9.30.2020.

- Rusinamodzi, 1,3,5 year refers to number of years intercropping has been used. 
- Sharma et al. is mulching with additions

10.14.2020.

- Steele et al. Using just data from the second off season time point. Those data points represent the system at its most mature point.
- Thierfelder and wall, using IR data from the latest measurement point
- When multiple IR metrics are reported, we collect the 'steady state' one or the 'capacity' measurement taken after the longest period of time

12.7.2020.

- Attempted to convert all data to the same units. Seems to work to some degree

1.14.2021. 

- To dos: 
  - Weighting a la Basche
  - Analysis of changes in SOC due to practices
  - Confirm that organic amendment papers actually are such
  - Model based on soil 
  - Check controls again
  
1.15.2021.

- To dos:
  - Weighting, need to revisit papers and count the number of experimental and control reps, maybe this is in the basche supp dataset
  - Review data one more time. Caught an error in one paper. 
  - Check the controls/treatments matrix. 
  - Re-do SEMs
  - Evaluate publication bias with histograms
  - Jacknife sensitivity analysis
